# Clustering-Credit-Card-Frauds
Self Organizing Map based on K-Means algorithm which clusters credit card applications into legit and fraud.
A Self Organizing Map (SOM) is fit over a given dataset to predict the potential fraud customers.
The map is then marked with circles and squares to see which potential fraud customers got their applications accepted.
Using inverse mapping, we find out the customers which were most likely to be frauds and got their credit card applications accepted.
This clustering method could be used to find identify and correct fake transactions.
